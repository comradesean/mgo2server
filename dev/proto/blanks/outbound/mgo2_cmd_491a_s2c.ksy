  title: "MGO2 0x491a — server -> client: clan notification — header only (no payload beyond the 6-byte key)"
  endian: be
  encoding: ISO-8859-1

  Evidence: GAME reply dispatcher `0xD387C8` (compare tree at `0xD38804`) matches `cmpwi 0x491a` at `0xd38804` and branches to the
  thunk at `0xd39720`, which tail-calls the parser at `0xd4d338`. Channel A (lobby TCP).

  Read primitives used throughout (identified from their own disassembly, not borrowed):
  `0xD5CB8C` u8, `0xD5CC14` u16, `0xD5CC64` / `0xD5CCD8` 4-byte (byte-identical twins),
  `0xD5D018` raw block of `r5` bytes, `0xD5C844` rewind-for-read, `0xD5C858` end-of-read.
  Every reader bound-checks against the **1023-byte receive buffer, not the payload length**,
  so a short payload does not fail — it silently reads whatever follows in the buffer.

  This is an **unsolicited clan notification**, not a reply: there is no result code and no
  request-status slot. The parser ends by raising client event **3** via `0xD33CD8(ctx, 3)`.

  The payload opens with the 6-byte key read by the shared helper `0xD49230(ctx, clan, reader)`:
  a u32 compared against the client's cached clan id (`clan+0x000`) and a u16 compared against
  `clan+0x29C`. Either mismatch returns `-1018` (`0xFFFFFC06`) and the packet is **discarded
  silently** — no dialog, no state change. So both words gate delivery; they are not payload.
  (`0x4960` is the one exception: the helper skips both comparisons for that id.)

  Nothing is read after the header. The parser calls `0xD49368` and `0xD4EC14` — the same
  local clan-state teardown `0x4915` runs — and then raises event 3. So the whole payload is
  the 6-byte key, and its effect is "your cached clan is gone".

  DISPATCHER ADDRESSING (corrected 2026-07-26). The address long cited as "the dispatcher" is
  the head of its **compare tree**, not the function entry. GAME: function 0xD387C8, tree head
  0xD38804. GATE: function 0xD361A4, tree head 0xD361E8. ACCOUNT: function 0xD37024, tree head
  0xD37074. It is also not a "literal compare chain": each tree head is immediately followed by
  a `bgt` (0xD3880C / 0xD361F0 / 0xD3707C) that splits the id space, i.e. a binary search, so
  ids are not tested in listed order and a "chain position" carries no meaning.
