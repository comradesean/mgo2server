  UNMAPPED SUBSYSTEM. Nothing in dev/docs/PROTOCOL.md or dev/docs/OBSERVED.md describes
  0x49C3; COMMANDS.md lists it only as "parsed but never sent". Everything below is read out of
  the client parser - field ORDER and WIDTH are solid, MEANINGS are not.

  Evidence: GAME dispatcher 0xD387C8, compare tree at 0xD38804, entry stub 0xD39840,
  parser 0xD4DE50.
  After RD_END the parser walks a 3-element client array (stride 44, 0xD4DF20-0xD4DF5C and
  0xD4DF60-0xD4DFA8, bound 88 = 2*44) matching the value it just read and clearing/refilling
  slot+12. So this is a single-record UPDATE against a small fixed table the client already
  holds - not a list reply.
  Read primitives (naming as in ../mgo2_cmd_4902.ksy): 0xD5CCD8 / 0xD5CC64 u32,
  0xD5CC14 / 0xD5CBC4 u16, 0xD5CB8C u8, 0xD5D018 raw N (writes a NUL at dest+N but consumes
  exactly N on the wire), 0xD5CE34 delimiter-terminated string, 0xD5CEB0 "cursor < payload length"
  (the only length-aware call). All of them bound-check the 1023-byte receive buffer, not the
  payload length, so a short packet desyncs rather than erroring - see mgo2_cmd_4902.ksy.

  ADDRESS AND SEMANTICS CORRECTION (2026-07-26, read out of the primitive itself): the string
  reader's entry point is **0xD5CE34**, not 0xD5CE3C — the previous function's `blr` is at
  0xD5CE30 and 0xD5CE3C is two instructions into the body. It is **not** a NUL-terminated
  string reader: the loop compares each byte against **r5, a caller-supplied delimiter**
  (`cmpw cr7,r0,r5` at 0xD5CE78); NUL is only a secondary stop (`cmpwi cr6,r0,0` at 0xD5CE7C).
  Callers that pass r5 = 0 get NUL termination as a special case. Either way the cursor is
  advanced **past** the terminator (`addi r9,r9,1` at 0xD5CEA4 after `stw r11` at 0xD5CE94), so
  the field consumes **len + 1** wire bytes, and the client writes its own NUL at dest+len
  (0xD5CE9C).

  DISPATCHER ADDRESSING (corrected 2026-07-26). The address long cited as "the dispatcher" is
  the head of its **compare tree**, not the function entry. GAME: function 0xD387C8, tree head
  0xD38804. GATE: function 0xD361A4, tree head 0xD361E8. ACCOUNT: function 0xD37024, tree head
  0xD37074. It is also not a "literal compare chain": each tree head is immediately followed by
  a `bgt` (0xD3880C / 0xD361F0 / 0xD3707C) that splits the id space, i.e. a binary search, so
  ids are not tested in listed order and a "chain position" carries no meaning.
