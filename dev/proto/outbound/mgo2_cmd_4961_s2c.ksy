  title: "MGO2 0x4961 — server -> client: clan notification carrying one 4-byte word"
  endian: be
  encoding: ISO-8859-1
doc: |
  Evidence: GAME reply dispatcher `0xD387C8` (compare tree at `0xD38804`) matches `cmpwi 0x4961` at `0xd38cb4` and branches to the
  thunk at `0xd39790`, which tail-calls the parser at `0xd4c6e8`. Channel A (lobby TCP).

  Read primitives used throughout (identified from their own disassembly, not borrowed):
  `0xD5CB8C` u8, `0xD5CC14` u16, `0xD5CC64` / `0xD5CCD8` 4-byte (byte-identical twins),
  `0xD5D018` raw block of `r5` bytes, `0xD5C844` rewind-for-read, `0xD5C858` end-of-read.
  Every reader bound-checks against the **1023-byte receive buffer, not the payload length**,
  so a short payload does not fail — it silently reads whatever follows in the buffer.

  This is an **unsolicited clan notification**, not a reply: there is no result code and no
  request-status slot. The parser ends by raising client event **11** via `0xD33CD8(ctx, 11)`.

  The payload opens with the 6-byte key read by the shared helper `0xD49230(ctx, clan, reader)`:
  a u32 compared against the client's cached clan id (`clan+0x000`) and a u16 compared against
  `clan+0x29C`. Either mismatch returns `-1018` (`0xFFFFFC06`) and the packet is **discarded
  silently** — no dialog, no state change. So both words gate delivery; they are not payload.
  (`0x4960` is the one exception: the helper skips both comparisons for that id.)

  Header, then a single 4-byte read stored at **clan+0x268** — `unknown_f` of the shared clan
  record. Post-processing walks the eight member slots resetting their state bytes (`0` and
  `4` are treated specially) and pushes a value into a roster object [READ 0xd4c7c0-0xd4c834].
  Payload 10 bytes; event 11.

  DISPATCHER ADDRESSING (corrected 2026-07-26). The address long cited as "the dispatcher" is
  the head of its **compare tree**, not the function entry. GAME: function 0xD387C8, tree head
  0xD38804. GATE: function 0xD361A4, tree head 0xD361E8. ACCOUNT: function 0xD37024, tree head
  0xD37074. It is also not a "literal compare chain": each tree head is immediately followed by
  a `bgt` (0xD3880C / 0xD361F0 / 0xD3707C) that splits the id space, i.e. a binary search, so
  ids are not tested in listed order and a "chain position" carries no meaning.
  **UI event dispatch, traced 2026-07-26.** This spec cites `0xD33CD8`. That helper is generic
  ("command N arrived") and does two things on the net-session context: it calls a callback at
  `netctx+0x11388 + 4*id` **immediately and synchronously inside the parse** if one is registered
  (`0xD33D24`), and it bumps a saturating one-byte pending counter at `netctx+0x11468 + id`
  (`0xD33D4C`), read and cleared by the poller `0xD33F8C`. Only ten ids are ever polled — `3`,
  `0x1C`, `0x1D`, `0x1E`, `0x22`, `0x24`, `0x27`, `0x28`, `0x29`, `0x37` — so any other event
  reaches the game **only** through the callback table. The value is handed to the callback and
  otherwise dropped; nothing queues. Enumerating every `bl 0xD33CD8` gives 49 sites with 49
  distinct ids, one per command parser, so the id says which command arrived and nothing about what
  is rendered. Full mechanism and its consequences: `dev/docs/PROTOCOL.md` "UI events: how
  0xD33CD8 dispatches".
